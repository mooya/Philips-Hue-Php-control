Philips Hue control script with Php &amp; MySQL

With this Php script you can control your Philips Hue.

See screenshots at: http://www.internovus.nl/portfolio/29/philips_hue_php_control_script.html

You can create your own scenes and change the state of each light.

Through a cronjob you can put lights on X minutes before or after sunset.


Files:
------------------------------------------------
includes\sql_settings.php > put your MySQL username and password in here

includes\settings.php > set the options used in the script (such as your Bridge IP, and Bridge Hash)

When a hash does not exist on the bridge you can create the hash in the automatically launch wizard.

See the database.sql file for the database layout.

The script uses JQuery, JQuery UI and jQuery UI Touch Punch > https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch

In first instance the script was created for personal use and testing purposes, but now more people can enjoy this.
